Graph/Cycle Encoding Imputation Strategy

This module implements the Graph/Cycle Encoding quantum-inspired imputation method,
which treats the 39 quantum positions as nodes in a cyclic graph (C₃₉ ring).
Uses Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to capture periodic patterns and harmonic
structure in the cyclic group, combined with graph-based features.

The quantum-inspired concept:
In quantum mechanics and group theory, cyclic groups appear naturally in periodic
systems. The C₃₉ cyclic group represents 39 positions arranged in a ring where
position i is adjacent to positions (i-1) mod 39 and (i+1) mod 39.

The DFT (implemented via FFT) decomposes the binary quantum state into frequency
components (harmonics), revealing periodic patterns that may not be obvious in
the spatial domain. This is analogous to how quantum systems can be analyzed
in momentum space (via Fourier transform of position space).

    """
    Graph/Cycle Encoding imputation strategy.

    Treats the 39 quantum positions as nodes in a cyclic graph (C₃₉ ring) and
    uses Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) combined with graph-based features
    to capture periodic patterns and structural relationships.

    Mathematical Background:
    ------------------------
    **Cyclic Graph (C₃₉)**:
    A cyclic graph with 39 nodes where each node i is connected to:
    - Previous node: (i-1) mod 39
    - Next node: (i+1) mod 39

    This creates a ring topology where position 1 is adjacent to both position 2
    and position 39. Distances between positions are measured as the shortest
    path on the ring (can go either direction).

    **Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)**:
    The DFT transforms the binary vector from spatial domain to frequency domain:
        F[k] = Σₙ x[n] * e^(-2πikn/N)

    For our binary vectors:
    - Input: Binary vector of length 39 (exactly 5 ones)
    - Output: Complex-valued frequency spectrum of length 39
    - k=0: DC component (average value, always 5/39 for our data)
    - k=1,2,...: Harmonics capturing periodic patterns

    We extract:
    - Magnitude spectrum: |F[k]| = sqrt(Re[F[k]]² + Im[F[k]]²)
    - Phase spectrum: angle(F[k]) = atan2(Im[F[k]], Re[F[k]])

    **Parseval's Theorem**:
    Energy conservation: Σₙ |x[n]|² = (1/N) Σₖ |F[k]|²
    For our binary vectors: left side = 5 (number of ones)

    Feature Engineering Strategy:
    ------------------------------
    This implementation creates three types of features:

    1. **DFT Magnitude Features** (n_harmonics features, default 20):
       The magnitude |F[k]| of the k-th harmonic. Captures the strength of
       periodic patterns at different frequencies. Lower harmonics (k=1,2,3)
       capture global patterns, higher harmonics capture local variations.

    2. **DFT Phase Features** (n_harmonics features, default 20):
       The phase angle(F[k]) of the k-th harmonic. Captures the alignment
       or shift of periodic patterns. Phases are in range [-π, π].

    3. **Graph Features** (~15-20 features):
       - Circular distances between active positions
       - Distance statistics (min, max, mean, std)
       - Clustering coefficient (how clustered active positions are)
       - Ring spread (angular span of active positions)
       - Symmetry measures

    Cyclic Group Properties:
    -------------------------
    The C₃₉ cyclic group has several interesting properties:
    - Order: 39 = 3 × 13 (not prime, has divisors)
    - Generators: Elements that can generate entire group
    - Subgroups: C₃ (every 13th position) and C₁₃ (every 3rd position)
    - DFT basis functions are the irreducible representations of C₃₉

    Parameters:
    -----------
    name : str, optional (default="graph_cycle_encoding")
        Human-readable name for this imputation strategy

    include_dft_features : bool, optional (default=True)
        Whether to include DFT magnitude and phase features.

    include_graph_features : bool, optional (default=True)
        Whether to include graph-based distance and clustering features.

    n_harmonics : int, optional (default=20)
        Number of DFT harmonics to keep (from 0 to n_harmonics-1).
        Must be in range [1, 39]. Lower values reduce dimensionality,
        higher values capture more detail.

    Output Dimensions:
    ------------------
    - With all features (default): (n_samples, 2*n_harmonics + ~17)
      = 40 (DFT magnitude) + 40 (DFT phase) + 17 (graph) = 57 features (n_harmonics=20)
    - Without DFT features: (n_samples, ~17) graph features only
    - Without graph features: (n_samples, 2*n_harmonics) DFT features only
    - Actual dimension depends on n_harmonics parameter

    Attributes:
    -----------
    n_harmonics : int
        Number of DFT harmonics to extract

    include_dft_features : bool
        Whether DFT features are included

    include_graph_features : bool
        Whether graph features are included

    Examples:
    ---------
    >>> from src.data_loader import load_dataset
    >>> from src.imputation.graph_cycle_encoding import GraphCycleEncoding
    >>>
    >>> # Load dataset

    >>> features = imputer.fit_transform(df)
    >>> print(features.shape)  # (11581, 57) with n_harmonics=20
    >>>
    >>> # More harmonics for higher resolution
    >>> imputer_full = GraphCycleEncoding(n_harmonics=39)
    >>> features_full = imputer_full.fit_transform(df)
    >>> print(features_full.shape)  # (11581, 95) = 78 DFT + 17 graph
    >>>
    >>> # Only DFT features
    >>> imputer_dft = GraphCycleEncoding(include_graph_features=False)
    >>> features_dft = imputer_dft.fit_transform(df)

    >>> features_graph = imputer_graph.fit_transform(df)
    >>> print(features_graph.shape)  # (11581, 17)

    Notes:
    ------
    - FFT is O(N log N) vs O(N²) for naive DFT, very efficient
    - DFT features are translation-invariant on the ring (rotation-invariant)
    - Low harmonics capture global structure, high harmonics capture fine details
    - Graph features complement DFT by providing explicit distance information
    - No learning from training data required (all features deterministic)
