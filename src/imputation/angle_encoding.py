Angle Encoding Imputation Strategy

This module implements the Angle Encoding quantum-inspired imputation method,
which maps binary quantum state vectors to rotation angles on the Bloch sphere.
Each position corresponds to a rotation angle, creating features that capture
angular relationships and cyclic symmetries.

The quantum-inspired concept:
In quantum computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation of quantum
states. A point on the sphere represents a pure quantum state, specified by
rotation angles (θ, φ). For our binary quantum states with 39 positions, we
map each position to an angle on a circle:
    θᵢ = 2π * (i-1) / 39  for position QV_i

This creates a natural cyclic structure (C₃₉ symmetry group) where position 1
and position 39 are adjacent on the circle. Active positions correspond to
specific angular orientations, and we extract both direct angles and
trigonometric features to capture rotational patterns.

class AngleEncoding(BaseImputer):
    """
    Angle Encoding imputation strategy.

    Maps binary quantum state vectors to rotation angles on a circular
    representation (Bloch sphere analogy). Each of the 39 positions corresponds
    to a specific angle on a circle, and active positions determine the overall
    rotational characteristics of the quantum state.

    Quantum Mechanics Background:
    ------------------------------
    In quantum computing, the Bloch sphere is a geometric representation where
    any pure qubit state can be represented as a point on a unit sphere. The
    state is determined by two angles (θ, φ) representing rotations:
        |ψ⟩ = cos(θ/2)|0⟩ + e^(iφ)sin(θ/2)|1⟩

    For our 39-position quantum states, we map each position to an angle on a
    circle (one-dimensional analog of Bloch sphere):
        Position i → Angle θᵢ = 2π * (i-1) / 39

    This creates a cyclic structure where positions are evenly distributed
    around a circle, respecting the C₃₉ cyclic group symmetry.

    Angular Feature Strategy:
    --------------------------
    This implementation creates three types of features:

    1. **Direct Angle Features** (39 features):
       The angle θᵢ for each position. Zero for inactive positions,
       non-zero (the assigned angle) for active positions.
       - Position 1 → θ₁ = 0
       - Position 2 → θ₂ = 2π/39 ≈ 0.161
       - Position 39 → θ₃₉ = 2π*(38)/39 ≈ 6.122

    2. **Trigonometric Features** (78 features):
       For each position, compute sin(θᵢ) and cos(θᵢ). These capture
       the (x, y) coordinates of the position on the unit circle.
       - 39 sine features: sin(θᵢ) for i=1..39
       - 39 cosine features: cos(θᵢ) for i=1..39
       Trigonometric features are naturally bounded [-1, 1] and capture
       rotational symmetries.

    3. **Aggregated Angle Features** (6 features):
       Summary statistics across the 5 active positions:
       - sum_sin: Σ sin(θᵢ) for active positions
       - sum_cos: Σ cos(θᵢ) for active positions
       - mean_sin: mean of sin(θᵢ) for active positions
       - mean_cos: mean of cos(θᵢ) for active positions
       - resultant_magnitude: ||sum_sin, sum_cos|| (vector length)
       - resultant_angle: atan2(sum_sin, sum_cos) (average direction)

       These features capture the "center of mass" of active positions on
       the circle, indicating whether active positions are clustered or
       spread out.

    Cyclic Symmetry (C₃₉ Group):
    ----------------------------
    The 39 positions form a cyclic group C₃₉ where position 1 is adjacent
    to position 39 (wrapping around). This is naturally encoded in the
    angular representation:
    - θ₁ = 0 and θ₃₉ ≈ 6.122 are close on the circle (differ by 2π/39)
    - Rotational operations preserve distances on the circle
    - Trigonometric features capture these circular relationships

    Parameters:
    -----------
    name : str, optional (default="angle_encoding")
        Human-readable name for this imputation strategy

    include_trig_features : bool, optional (default=True)
        Whether to include trigonometric (sin/cos) features.
        - If True: includes both angle and trig features
        - If False: only includes direct angle features

    include_aggregated_features : bool, optional (default=True)
        Whether to include aggregated angle statistics.
        - If True: adds 6 summary features across active positions
        - If False: omits aggregated features

    Output Dimensions:
    ------------------
    - With all features (default): (n_samples, 123)
      = 39 (angles) + 78 (sin/cos) + 6 (aggregated) = 123 features
    - Without trig features: (n_samples, 45)
      = 39 (angles) + 6 (aggregated) = 45 features
    - Without aggregated features: (n_samples, 117)
      = 39 (angles) + 78 (sin/cos) = 117 features
    - Only angles: (n_samples, 39)

    Attributes:
    -----------
    position_angles_ : np.ndarray, shape (39,)
        Pre-computed angles for each position: θᵢ = 2π * (i-1) / 39
        Set during initialization (not learned from data).

    >>> from src.data_loader import load_dataset

               (0 for inactive, θᵢ for active)
            3. Create trig features: sin_feat[i] = sin(θᵢ) * QV[i]
                                     cos_feat[i] = cos(θᵢ) * QV[i]

               - resultant_angle: Direction of sum vector
            5. Concatenate all feature types

        Mathematical Details:
            Direct angle features:
                angle_feat[i] = θᵢ × QV[i]
                where θᵢ = 2π(i-1)/39

            Trigonometric features:
                sin_feat[i] = sin(θᵢ) × QV[i]
                cos_feat[i] = cos(θᵢ) × QV[i]

            Aggregated features (for 5 active positions):
                sum_sin = Σ sin(θⱼ) for j in active positions
                sum_cos = Σ cos(θⱼ) for j in active positions

                mean_cos = sum_cos / 5

                resultant_angle = atan2(sum_sin, sum_cos)

            Resultant vector interpretation:
                If active positions are evenly distributed around the circle,
                resultant_magnitude ≈ 0 (vectors cancel out).
                If active positions are clustered, resultant_magnitude is large
                and resultant_angle points toward the cluster center.
