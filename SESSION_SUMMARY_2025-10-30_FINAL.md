# Session Summary - October 30, 2025 (FINAL)
## Critical Discovery: Fundamental Imputation Architecture Issue

---

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL FINDING**: After extensive testing on both local and RunPod environments, we discovered that the quantum imputation methods have a **fundamental architectural flaw** that prevents true holdout testing.

**ROOT CAUSE**: The imputers were designed to transform historical data where winners are KNOWN, creating features that directly encode the answer. This makes true forward prediction impossible without redesigning the imputation architecture.

**STATUS**: RunPod successfully configured and tested. Code works correctly. But results reveal architectural limitation requiring redesign.

---

## Session Timeline

### Morning: Data Leakage Discovery
- Reviewed October 29 RunPod results (100% perfect recall - INVALID)
- User correctly identified same data leakage issue from before
- Root cause: On-the-fly imputation using test event's QV values

### Afternoon: v4.0 Pre-Imputed Architecture
- Created `production/true_holdout_test_v4.0_PRE_IMPUTED.py`
- Used pre-computed imputed datasets instead of on-the-fly imputation
- Fixed JSON serialization bug (numpy int64/float64 types)
- Created RunPod package v4.0 (29MB)

### Evening: RunPod Deployment and Testing
- Successfully deployed to RunPod
- Overcame Python 3.13 compatibility issues (switched to Python 3.11)
- Fixed missing dependencies (base_ranker.py, six module)
- Ran 1-event test: 100% perfect (concerning)
- Ran 10-event test: 100% perfect on ALL events (confirmed issue)

### Critical Discovery
**All 10 test events showed 100% perfect results (0 wrong) for all 4 models**

This revealed the fundamental problem: Pre-imputed datasets encode the answers.

---

## The Fundamental Problem

### How Imputers Currently Work

**Amplitude Embedding Example:**
```python
# Input: Binary QV vector [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 1, ...]
#                          ↑winner    ↑winner

# Imputer transforms:
qv_data = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, ..., 1, ...]  # The ANSWER!
amplitudes = qv_data / sqrt(sum(qv_data^2))
# Result: [0.0, 0.0, 0.4472, 0.0, ..., 0.4472, ...]
#                    ↑winner           ↑winner
```

**The Problem**:
- Winners get non-zero amplitude (0.4472)
- Non-winners get zero amplitude (0.0)
- Model learns: "if amplitude ≠ 0, then winner"
- **This is trivial pattern recognition, not prediction!**

### Why Pre-Imputed Datasets Don't Fix This

Even though features are pre-computed:
1. `regenerate_imputed_datasets.py` reads raw CSV with QV columns
2. Imputers use QV values to create features
3. Features encode which positions are winners
4. Saved to `data/imputed/*.csv`
5. Models trained on these features learn the encoding
6. **Perfect recall because features literally contain the answer**

### Test Results Proving the Issue

**10-Event Test on RunPod:**
```
AMPLITUDE:      10/10 events with 0 wrong (100.00%)
ANGLE_ENCODING: 10/10 events with 0 wrong (100.00%)
GRAPH_CYCLE:    10/10 events with 0 wrong (100.00%)
DENSITY_MATRIX: 10/10 events with 0 wrong (100.00%)
```

Events tested: 11580-11589 (last 10 events)

**Identical results on local Windows machine** - proves this isn't a platform issue, it's architectural.

## What Was Accomplished Today

### ✅ Successful Achievements

1. **Identified Root Cause**
   - Data leakage from imputation design, not test implementation
   - Clear understanding of why 100% perfect results occur

2. **Fixed Multiple Technical Issues**
   - JSON serialization (numpy types → Python types)
   - Python 3.13 compatibility (pandas/numpy version conflicts)
   - Missing dependencies (base_ranker.py, six module)
   - RunPod package deployment

3. **Created Working Test Infrastructure**
   - `production/true_holdout_test_v4.0_PRE_IMPUTED.py` (works correctly)
   - `runpod_json_fix.py` (patcher script)
   - `RUNPOD_COMMANDS_v4.0.md` (deployment guide)
   - RunPod package v4.0 (complete, tested)

4. **Validated Test Consistency**
   - Same results on local and RunPod
   - Confirms code correctness
   - Timing differences expected (RunPod faster: 65-74s vs local 140-160s per event)

### ❌ What Doesn't Work

**Quantum Imputation for True Holdout Testing**

The imputers CANNOT be used for forward prediction without knowing the winners because:
- Amplitude requires QV values to compute amplitudes
- Angle requires QV values to map positions to angles
- Density Matrix requires QV values to compute density matrices
- Graph/Cycle requires QV values to compute DFT

## The Architectural Challenge

### Current Design (By Epic)

**Epic 1: Data Ingestion**
- Loads raw CSV with event-ID and QV columns
- QV columns indicate winners (1) vs non-winners (0)

**Epic 2: Quantum Imputation**
- Transforms binary QV vectors into quantum-inspired features
- **REQUIRES QV values (the answer) to create features**
- 4 methods: Amplitude, Angle, Density Matrix, Graph/Cycle

**Epic 3: Ranking Models**
- LGBM rankers learn from imputed features
- Predict top-20 positions

**Epic 4-5: Validation & Ensembles**
- Can't validate on true holdout data (features encode answers!)

### Why This Design Can't Do Holdout Testing

**Holdout Test Requirements:**
1. Train on events 1 to N-1
2. Predict event N **without knowing winners**
3. Compare predictions to actual winners

**Current Imputation Breaks Rule #2:**
```
Event N arrives → Need to impute → Requires QV values → But QV values ARE the answer!
```

**Circular Dependency:**
```
To predict → Need features → Need to impute → Need QV values → Need to know winners → But that's what we're trying to predict!
```

## Three Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Acknowledge Limitation (Simplest)

**Approach**: Accept that imputation methods are for feature engineering on historical data, not for real-time prediction.

**Use Cases:**
- **Training**: Use imputed features to train models on historical data ✅
- **Backtesting**: Test on different time periods (create imputed dataset A from events 1-1000, test on imputed dataset B from events 5001-6000)
- **Production**: Use a different prediction method (frequency, LGBM on raw features, etc.)

**Pros:**
- No code changes needed
- Existing imputation code is correct for its purpose
- Can still compare imputation methods on historical data

**Cons:**
- Can't use quantum features for real-time prediction
- Defeats purpose of quantum-inspired feature engineering

---

### Option 2: Time-Based Split (Medium Complexity)

**Approach**: Create imputed datasets from non-overlapping time periods.

**Implementation:**
1. Split raw data into Period A (events 1-5000) and Period B (events 5001-11589)
2. Run `regenerate_imputed_datasets.py` on ONLY Period A
3. Save imputed_A.csv (contains events 1-5000 with their features)
4. Train models on imputed_A.csv
5. Run `regenerate_imputed_datasets.py` on ONLY Period B
6. Save imputed_B.csv (contains events 5001-11589 with their features)
7. Test models on imputed_B.csv

**Key Requirement:** Events in Period B were never seen during Period A imputation.

**Pros:**
- Can validate quantum features are useful vs raw features
- Relatively simple to implement
- Proves models generalize to new time periods

**Cons:**
- Still not "true" forward prediction (features created after event occurred)
- Smaller training set (only Period A)
- Doesn't solve real-time prediction problem

---

### Option 3: Redesign Imputation (Complex - Recommended Long-Term)

**Approach**: Create imputation methods that don't require knowing the winners.

**New Design Principles:**
1. **Use Historical Patterns Only**
   - Compute features based on previous events only
   - Example: "Position 15 was a winner in 23% of last 100 events"

2. **Context-Based Features**
   - Time since last occurrence at each position
   - Co-occurrence patterns (when pos 15 wins, pos 23 often wins too)
   - Cyclic patterns (C₃₉ group structure)

3. **Quantum-Inspired Without QV Values**
   - Use position relationships from C₃₉ group (angles, distances, symmetries)
   - Historical probability distributions as "quantum states"
   - Temporal evolution of position frequencies

**Example New Imputer:**
```python
class HistoricalPatternImputer(BaseImputer):
    """
    Create features from historical patterns, not current QV values.
    """

    def transform(self, X: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
        """
        X contains:
        - event-ID
        - NO QV COLUMNS! (because we don't know winners yet)

        Creates features from:
        - Historical position frequencies
        - Time-based patterns
        - C₃₉ group structure
        - Previous event patterns
        """
        features = []

        for event_id in X['event-ID']:
            # Get all PREVIOUS events (< event_id)
            historical = self.training_data[
                self.training_data['event-ID'] < event_id
            ]

            # Compute features for each position (1-39)
            for pos in range(1, 40):
                # Historical frequency
                freq = historical[f'QV_{pos}'].mean()

                # Time since last win
                last_win = historical[historical[f'QV_{pos}'] == 1]['event-ID'].max()
                time_since = event_id - last_win if pd.notna(last_win) else 999999

                # Cyclic position features (from C₃₉ group)
                angle = 2 * np.pi * (pos - 1) / 39

                features.append({
                    f'pos_{pos}_freq': freq,
                    f'pos_{pos}_time_since': time_since,
                    f'pos_{pos}_angle_sin': np.sin(angle),
                    f'pos_{pos}_angle_cos': np.cos(angle)
                })

        return pd.DataFrame(features)
```

**Pros:**
- Enables true forward prediction
- Still quantum-inspired (uses C₃₉ structure, temporal evolution)
- Can do real holdout testing
- Aligns with original project goal

**Cons:**
- Significant redesign required
- All 4 imputation methods need rewrite
- Must retrain all models
- More complex feature engineering

## Key Insights

### What We Learned

1. **User's Intuition Was Correct**
   - "This is exactly what happened the previous time" - Absolutely right
   - User immediately recognized impossible 100% results as data leakage
   - Trust user's domain knowledge!

2. **Pre-Imputed ≠ No Leakage**
   - Moving imputation earlier doesn't solve the problem
   - The imputation METHOD is the issue, not the timing

3. **Design Assumptions Matter**
   - Imputers were designed for "transform historical data"
   - We're trying to use them for "predict future events"
   - These are fundamentally different use cases

4. **Testing Reveals Truth**
   - 100% perfect results across 10 events is impossible
   - Statistics don't lie
   - Better to find this now than in production

### What's Actually Working

**The Code:**
- Test harness is correct
- Model training works
- Predictions work
- JSON serialization fixed
- RunPod deployment works

**The Problem:**
- Not the code
- Not the test design
- **It's the imputation architecture**

## Questions for Product Owner

1. **Project Goals**: Is true forward prediction required, or is historical analysis sufficient?

2. **Quantum Features**: How important are quantum-inspired features vs traditional features?

3. **Timeline**: How much time can we allocate to redesigning imputation?

4. **Validation**: What level of recall@20 would be acceptable? (Currently impossible to measure without redesign)

5. **Production Use**: How will this system be used in production?
   - Real-time prediction? (Requires redesign)
   - Historical analysis only? (Current code works)
   - Hybrid approach? (Option 2 - time-based split)
