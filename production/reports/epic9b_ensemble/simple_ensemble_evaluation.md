# Story 9B.1: Simple Ensemble Evaluation Report

**Date:** 2025-10-17 12:37:37
**Epic:** Epic 9B - Ensemble & Bias Correction
**Story:** 9B.1 - Simple Ensemble Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

### Ensemble Performance
- **Ensemble Recall@20:** 100.00%
- **Best Individual Model:** LGBM (100.00%)
- **Performance Difference:** +0.00% (no improvement)

### Recommendation: [OK] Proceed with Ensemble

The ensemble matches the best individual model. 
Ensembles provide robustness by combining multiple perspectives, even if performance 
is equivalent. Proceed to Story 9B.2 (Bias Correction) using this ensemble.

## Holdout Performance Comparison

### Performance Table

| Model | Recall@20 | Perfect Recall Events | Perfect Recall % |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|------------------|
| LGBM | 100.00% | 1000/1000 | 100.0% |
| SetTransformer | 100.00% | 1000/1000 | 100.0% |
| GNN | 100.00% | 1000/1000 | 100.0% |
| **SimpleEnsemble (equal weights)** | **100.00%** | **1000/1000** | **100.0%** |

### Key Observations

- [OK] All models (individual and ensemble) achieve 100% holdout recall
- [OK] No model is clearly inferior - ensemble maintains perfect performance
- [OK] Ensemble provides redundancy without sacrificing accuracy

## Model Contributions

### Weight Distribution

Ensemble uses **equal weighting** strategy:

- **LGBMRanker:** 0.333 (33.3%)
- **SetTransformerRanker:** 0.333 (33.3%)
- **GNNRanker:** 0.333 (33.3%)

### Analysis

With equal weighting, each model contributes 33.3% to the final prediction. 
This is the simplest ensemble strategy and works well when all models have 
similar performance.

**Future Optimizations (if needed):**
- Confidence-based weighting: Weight by model prediction confidence per event
- Position-aware weighting: Weight differently for LOW/MID/HIGH ranges (from Epic 8 analysis)
- Custom weights: Manually tune based on individual model strengths

## Next Steps

### [OK] Proceed to Story 9B.2: Bias Correction

The ensemble has been validated and is ready for bias correction. Story 9B.2 will:

1. Calculate bias correction factors from Epic 9A Density Matrix data
2. Implement RangeAwareBiasCorrection class
3. Apply correction to reduce ~300% bias to <150%
4. Evaluate impact on Recall@20 and bias reduction

## Technical Details

- **Holdout Set:** 1,000 events (last 1,000 from imputed_density_matrix_full.parquet)
- **Evaluation Metric:** Recall@20 (% of 5 actual winning positions in top-20 predictions)
- **Ensemble Strategy:** Equal weighting (1/3 per model)
- **Models Combined:** LGBM, SetTransformer, GNN (all from Density Matrix imputation)
