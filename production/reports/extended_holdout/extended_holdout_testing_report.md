# Extended Holdout Testing Report - Story 8.1

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Epic:** Epic 8 - Model Performance Analysis
**Story:** 8.1 - Extended Holdout Testing

---

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes the performance of all 3 production models (LGBM, SetTransformer, GNN) 
on holdout test sets of varying sizes (100, 500, 1000 events). The goal is to identify 
performance trends and understand model strengths/weaknesses.

### Models Tested
- **LGBM**: Gradient Boosting (LightGBM)
- **SetTransformer**: Attention-based Set Transformer
- **GNN**: Graph Neural Network (GAT)

### Holdout Sizes
- **100 events**: Small sample (most recent)
- **500 events**: Medium sample (most recent)
- **1,000 events**: Full Epic 5 holdout (most recent)

## Recommendations

Based on extended holdout testing:

1. **Best Overall Model**: SETTRANSFORMER (highest Recall@20 on full holdout)
2. **Most Consistent Model**: Analyze coefficient of variation above
3. **Next Steps**: Proceed to Story 8.2 (Position-level analysis) to understand 
   why certain positions are harder to predict.
