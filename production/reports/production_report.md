# Generate features
imputer = AngleEncoding()
features = imputer.transform(quantum_state)

# Create DataFrame
feature_names = [f'angle_feat_{i}' for i in range(len(features))]
event_df = pd.DataFrame([features], columns=feature_names)

# Add dummy targets (required by interface)
for i in range(1, 6):
